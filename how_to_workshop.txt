how to do the thing.

+ set the default script editor = go to preferences and then External Tools.

+ make an empty. call that the game. then attach the game script to it.
+ drag shit to it. give it the right prefabs so it knows how to spawn things.
+ try run that, it fails.
+ oh, there's a null reference.
+ make a canvas.
+ throw some TMP on there.
+ use the anchor and pivot stuff to position it nicely.
+ use the right TMP_Text in the source.
+ now we gotta assign gameOverUI.
+ make the camera bgrnd black.
+ finding that explosionEffect does not exist.
	+ create particle thing. then notice that circle shape is in the 3d space.
	+ how to rotate? go to the left thing and then there is the rotate button.
	+ oh nvm, if I just check the transform properties, find that I can reset. then it's good.
+ there was no .SetActive unless I accessed the GameObject directly. that was quite odd,
  I thought it would have went and did the thing where it does inheritance, but no.


TODO:
- player is not that responsive.
- there are too many comments in the code, and the code is bad.
- the coarse collision is really not that good.
